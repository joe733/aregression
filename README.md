## Troubleshooting

- Double check if you've followed the steps mentioned in the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/plymouth) to install Plymouth
- Make sure that your login manager has the Plymouth daemon enabled, see ArchWiki on how to do it.
- It's known that lower screen resolution have scaling issue. For now it works well with 1920 x 1080 displays. I'm working on it.
- Try using installing a grub theme, and see if any graphic driver is causing resolution issues. Related: https://askubuntu.com/questions/362722/how-to-fix-plymouth-splash-screen-in-all-ubuntu-releases
- Does your grub file contains this line `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"`?
- If nothing works create an [issue](https://github.com/joe733/plymouth-theme-aregression/issues).
