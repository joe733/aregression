## **Installing**

Follow instructions on ArchWiki to install and setup [Plymouth](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/plymouth).

```bash
$ yay -S plymouth-theme-aregression

# Or use makepkg -si after cloning from https://aur.archlinux.org/plymouth-theme-aregression
```

#### If you're a [chaotic-aur](https://aur.chaotic.cx) user...

```
$ sudo pacman -S plymouth-theme-aregression
```

## **Setting up**

```bash
# You should see aregression listed
$ sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -l

# Change plymouth theme
$ sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R aregression
```

## **Removal**

```bash
$ yay -Rs plymouth-theme-aregression
# https://aur.archlinux.org/plymouth-theme-aregression
```

## **Troubleshooting**

- Double check if you've followed the steps mentioned in the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/plymouth) to install Plymouth
- It's known that lower screen resolution has scaling issue. For now it works well with `1920 x 1080` displays. I'm working on it.
- Try using installing a grub theme, and see if any graphic driver is causing resolution issues. Related: <https://askubuntu.com/questions/362722/how-to-fix-plymouth-splash-screen-in-all-ubuntu-releases/>
- Does your grub file contains this line `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"`?
- If nothing works create an [issue](https://github.com/joe733/plymouth-theme-aregression/issues).
